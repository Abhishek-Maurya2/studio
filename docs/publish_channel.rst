Publish Channels
################

You must publish the content channel each time you add new learning resources, update metadata, or change the topic tree structure.

To publish a content channel, follow these steps.

#. Click **PUBLISH** button in the upper right corner of the channel content page.
   
   .. note:: If there are no changes in the channel content, **No changes detected** will be displayed instead of the **PUBLISH** button.

#. Review the list of content that is going to be published.
#. Check if the channel language is correctly set in the drop-down menu.
#. Click **PUBLISH** button in the lower right corner of the dialog.

Once the server finishes processing the new content, the following
confirmation message will appear:

      Confirmation message after the channel is published.

Now you can share the published channel with administrators at your facilities or the whole world: just copy the channel ID/token (use the button **COPY** in the above message), and send it to them by email.

.. tip:: Remember to re-publish the channel each time you make changes or updates to content items. The channel ID/token remains the same but administrators will need to import it again into Kolibri, in order to make the changes and the new content available on the devices in their facilities.
